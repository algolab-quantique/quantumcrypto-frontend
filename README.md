# QuantumCrypto Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of QuantumCrypto! This project aims to
gamify quantum cryptography protocols for quantum computing education. The
frontend is built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

## Introduction

QuantumCrypto is an innovative framework designed to provide an interactive
multiplayer learning experience for understanding quantum cryptography
protocols and quantum computing concepts.
